## PROJECT TITLE: SORTING ALGORITHM
### DESCRIPTION: This project explores various data structures task in Sorting Algorithm

#### INTRODUCTION
In data structures we have Six (6) fundamental operations that can be performed which are acronyms (TISSDM):
* Tranversing
* Insertion 
* Searching
* Sorting
* Deleting
* Merging 
This project explores the Sorting operation on Data Structures such as Arrays, linked List, Stacks e.t.c

### Sorting Operation 
There are various algorithm utilized in sorting operation in Data structures. The project explores both the basic and advanced sorting operation.

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Quick Sort
